* Description of SONGBIRD solver for SLCOMP'18

Songbird is an automated theorem prover for Separation Logic entailments. At its
core, Songbird employs mathematical induction to prove entailments involving
user-defined inductive heap predicates. It is also equipped with a mutual
induction proof technique to speculate lemmas from entailments derived in proof
trees and an automatic lemma synthesis to derive neccessary lemmas from scratch.
